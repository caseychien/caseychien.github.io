      Hello! My name is Casey and I am a freshman at UC Santa Cruz studying computer science.
      <br><br>
      I was born and raised in the Bay Area.
      <br><br>
      I am an avid runner (check out my Strava below!) and have a deep apprecation for food, nature, and dogs (not necessarily in that order).
      <br><br>
      I am just beginning to start my journey into the real world and am excited to see where it will lead me.
